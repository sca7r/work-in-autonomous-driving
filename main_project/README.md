# ADAPT OVERVIEW
Welcome to the main repository of **ADAPT** System. This repository will help you navigate through our organization repositories and hopefully provide a comprehensive understanding of the system architecture and breifly describe components functionality.

### **Question Zero:**
To better understand how this project came to life and what ideas are behined it, let's take a look at our **Question Zero**, in which we try to answer the following about our project; What, For Whom, Where, Why, How:

> :bulb: **Question Zero:** *How can we design an infrastructure-based End2End parking solution for all people arriving with an Autonomous vehicle into the covered urban area, to eliminate the distance traveled & effort required for parking, and reduce emissions, by integrating the leading edge technologies in communication, sensing infrastructure, and autonomous driving?*

### Use Case: 
Parking Autonomously to the Nearest Feasible Parking Spot

* **Main Actors:** Ego Vehicle, Infrastructure

* **Preconditions:**  
 1. Infrastructure monitors parking spots in the vicinity.
 2. User is at their destination.

* **Success Guarantee:** EV parked at the selected spot according to the user preferences.

* **Steps:**  
    1. User starts the process by selecting desired preferences on the VI.
    2. EV initiates communication with infrastructure for parking spots list.
    3. EV receives available spot data from infrastructure.
    4. EV sends confirmation to infrastructure about the chosen spot.
    5. EV selects best route to the parking spot.
    6. EV drives autonomously and parks at the spot.
    7. User can live track his EV using the MI

# UML Diagrams 

## [Acivity Diagram ](https://git.hs-coburg.de/ADAPT/adapt_main/src/branch/main/images/activity_diagram.png)
This diagram outlines the interaction between the autonomous vehicle (referred to as the EV) and the infrastructure from the point where the user commands the EV to park. The EV sends a request for available spots and receives a list from the infrastructure, which also makes the selected spot unavailable to others. The EV then computes a feasible path and begins navigating. The process takes into account obstacles, updating the path as necessary. Behavior planning and control are involved in navigating to the location, culminating in the vehicle parking itself assuming no objects are present in the parking space.

## [State Diagram ](https://git.hs-coburg.de/ADAPT/adapt_main/src/branch/main/images/State_Diagram.jpg)
This diagram depicts the various states that an Electric Vehicle (EV) goes through during the process of finding and parking in a parking spot. The process begins when the car arrives at the user destination and enters the idle state, where it locks the door and communicates with the infrastructure to obtain a parking spot. Next, it transitions to the drive state, where it processes data for control and object detection while en route to the parking spot. If an obstacle is detected, it will not proceed to parking. Once near the parking spot, it checks for accessibility, and if it's suitable, the car parks itself. Finally, when the car is in the parking spot, it stops, signaling that it has parked.

## [Sequence  Diagram ](https://git.hs-coburg.de/ADAPT/adapt_main/src/branch/main/images/sequence_diagram.png)
This sequence diagram illustrates the communication flow between the autonomous vehicle, the infrastructure, and other system components during the parking process. It starts with the vehicle requesting localization information, selecting a parking spot, and the infrastructure acknowledging this selection. The vehicle then receives localization data from GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) and digital maps, and the parking process is executed based on this data. The diagram shows a sequence of communications, including the transmission of the vehicle's location, user preferences, and the selected parking spot's location, which are crucial for the vehicle's navigation and parking operation.

## Functionalities

### [Vehicle Interface](https://git.hs-coburg.de/ADAPT/adapt_vi)
The Vehicle Interface generates a Graphical Interface for ADAPT. The first frame is the 
introduction to the Adapt system with a "GO" button which takes the user to 2nd frame in 
which the user can type in the Name, Licence plate number and select a checkbox for 
Preference of parking.
### [EV Transceiver](https://git.hs-coburg.de/ADAPT/adapt_transceiver) 
This component is responsible for transmitting CAM, CPM, EVCSN messages and receiving 
data between Ego-vehicle, Infrastructure, and other traffic participants.
### [Infrastructure Transceiver](https://git.hs-coburg.de/ADAPT/adapt_inf_trans)
The infrastructure transceiver is like a translator that changes the parking spot list into an 
EVCSN message. It listens to the parking spot list that's shared under the topic "/spot_list" and 
then translates that information into the EVCSN message.
### [Spot Selector](https://git.hs-coburg.de/ADAPT/adapt_spotsl)
The Parking Spot Selector component works between the Vehicle Interface (VI), the 
infrastructure's (EV CSN) messages, and Route Computer. It receives user-chosen preferences 
from the Vehicle Interface and aggregates EV CSN messages from the infrastructure, which 
contain attributes and locations of available parking spots. Upon receiving this information, 
the Parking Spot Selector sends the selected parking spot location to the Route Computer and 
the Infrastructure, facilitating the booking and navigation process. 
### [Spot Updater](https://git.hs-coburg.de/ADAPT/adapt_inf_spotupd) 
The main function of Spot Updater is to update the list of available parking spot based on the 
input from the object detection and spot selector continuously. Whenever the spot updater 
receives a selected spot from the spot selector by the EV it updates the available parking spots. 
### [Localization](https://git.hs-coburg.de/ADAPT/adapt_loc) 
The localization component provides a precise location of the Ego-Vehicle with respect to its 
environment. It is designed to handle real-time localization data from motion capture systems 
used in the Model City. It processes incoming data from the motion capture system, and 
publishes X, Y, Z positions and orientation (Euler angles). The component leverages 
quaternion to Euler conversion to provide intuitive angle representations.
### [Route Computer](https://git.hs-coburg.de/ADAPT/adapt_roucomp) 
Route computer is a component which determines the process of figuring out the optimum 
route to the selected parking spot. It outputs an effective route for the EV to reach its selected 
parking spot which is further sent to Trajectory Planner and the route_state gets published to the Behaviour Planning. 
### [Environment Model](https://git.hs-coburg.de/ADAPT/adapt_envmod) 
This component is responsible for the environment perception for the ADAPT. It recieves 
detected objects from LiDAR and detectnet and the vehicle position through Localization 
component and publishes them in the form of OccupancyGrid for the rest of the system. 
### [Behaviour Planning](https://git.hs-coburg.de/ADAPT/adapt_behplan.git)
Behaviour Planning is a decision making componenet which is a finite state machine which subscribes to specific topics and when triggers are received from those topics it transitions into specific states.
### [Lateral and Longitudinal control](https://git.hs-coburg.de/ADAPT/adapt_latlongcon.git) 
In our system architecture, the vehicle's movement is controlled by the lateral and longitudinal 
component. It takes the speed manoeuvres from the Behaviour planning component and then 
sends the command via CAN BUS to the drive motor.
### [Trajectory PLanner](https://git.hs-coburg.de/ADAPT/adapt_trajp.git) 
The trajectory planner take care of smoothing the path generated by the path planning component(adapt_roucomp) with the help of interpolation, cubicspline has been implemented to carry out this task. The component also calculate the parking maneuver through circles and line segments.
